Google API Examples
===================

+ A simple showcase of my Google API work.

+ The GoogleMap.html page is a demonstration of the Google Map API using the point marker system to mark various places in Merced.

+ The FieldWork.html page represents recorded longitude, latitude, height, and width(DBH value) of trees around the UC Merced quad area.
+ The engr180treedataGroup5.xlsx is an excel worksheet containing the tree data contained on the FieldWorks.html page.

+ The functions.html page is a test of simple functions using javascript:
- The first function is a for loop on an array.
- The second function is a time function.
- The third function is simple demonstration of array usage, using the first index of the array.
